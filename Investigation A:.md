Investigation A:

Do bats perceive rats not just as competitors for food but also as potential predators? If rats are considered
a predation risk by bats, scientists believe that this perception will translate into the bats’ higher level of
avoidance behaviour or increased vigilance during foraging on the food platform.


Dataset1:
dataset1.csv
The first dataset focuses on what happens each time a bat lands on a provisioned food platform when
rats are present. Each row in this dataset is a unique, single bat landing on the food platform. It further
describes the situational context and a bat’s observed behaviours following its landing.
The zoologists manually detected each bat landings from the collected surveillance video footage, as
previously described. Behavioural variables such as vigilance and foraging success of each landing were
then manually annotated and quantified by watching the video recordings. Table 1 explains the meaning
of variables in this dataset

Dataset2:
dataset2.csv
The second dataset focuses on rats’ arrival events at the food platform. Each row in the dataset represents
the outcome of a 30-minute continuous video surveillance recording of the same food platform as the
one mentioned in dataset1.csv. The number of unique rat arrivals within each 30-minute interval was then
manually counted from the recordings and aggregated. The dataset contains some other observations,
such as the total number of bat landings and estimated food depletion in each period. Table 2 explains
the meaning of variables in this dataset
